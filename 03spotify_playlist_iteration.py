Prediction on running program 3 with the following inputs:
- Playlist: "My Vibes"
- Songs: 5
- Moods: happy, sad, energetic, happy, chill

Prediction:
- Inputs saved into the corresponding variables
- Eventually happy_songs = 2, sad_songs = 1, energetic_songs = 1, chill_songs = 1

Outputs:
"Your playlist 'My Vibes' analysis:
2 happy songs (40%)
1 sad songs (20%)
1 energetic songs (20%)
1 chill songs (20%)
Overall mood: Upbeat! :)

How does the counter system work?

What determines the "Overall mood"?
- The amount of happy songs relative to the amount of sad songs.
